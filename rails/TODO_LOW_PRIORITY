one using ab and multiple concurrency :)

could also do more views than just the root [like an index with lots of products, many navigation tags]

do tests that re-use a single session id, instead of recreating one each time, as it currently does [using ab?]

test with 1.9
could use a rails test with rails 2.2 or beyond

one with very complex logic or a very large page would be a good test
