one using ab and multiple concurrency :)

could also do more views than just the root [like an index with lots of products {"at least x"}, and many navigation tags]

do tests that re-use a single session id, instead of recreating one each time, as it currently does [using ab?] -- might be able to create a profile script that runs it 100x, instead of running the same profile script 100x

test with 1.9/jruby to see if it works?

could use a rails test with rails 2.2 or beyond 

one with very complex logic or a very large page would be a good test

could make the startup time become 1/10th startup time.
some requests with 'extra' RAM using garbage before the test

add 'read a file 1000x' test.

There's a few more tests listed on the mailing list that could be included, and also luis' sudoku solver.

research into this oddness [vlow prio--can you do bootstrap twice and it work?]:

with a db:drop and [err and] recreate between them. huh?
